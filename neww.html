    🔹 The Fake News Detection system was successfully developed using NLP and Machine Learning techniques.  
    🔹 Two models, <b>Logistic Regression</b> and <b>Random Forest</b>, were trained and evaluated using both internal (WELFake) and external (IFND) datasets.  
    🔹 Feature extraction using <b>TF-IDF</b> allowed the models to understand textual patterns effectively.  
    🔹 The best-performing model (<b>{best_model_name}</b>) achieved strong accuracy and F1-score, demonstrating reliable detection of FAKE vs. REAL news.  
    🔹 This system can be extended for real-time deployment, helping users instantly verify news content and combat misinformation.
